# Changelog

## Unreleased

- The project skeleton, made with `foundry-make` from `__templates/rust`.
- The crate layout: permissive `spoolframe-types`, `-protocol` and
  `-client-sdk`; AGPL `spoolframe-plex` and `spoolframe-server`. A workspace
  test keeps the permissive crates from reaching an AGPL crate.
- `spoolframe-server --config <file>` loads a UCL config (schema
  `spoolframe.server.v1`, `state_dir`); unknown and repeated keys fail.
- `spoolframe-types`: the public media model (libraries, movies, shows,
  seasons, episodes, artists, albums, tracks, artwork, playback state) and
  namespaced string IDs such as `plex:movie:12345`.
- `spoolframe-catalog`: the `Catalog` trait (libraries, paged listings, an
  item with its children, search, media file path).
- `spoolframe-plex`: `PlexCatalog`, reading movies, shows and music from a
  Plex Media Server on the LAN, with an optional token.
- The server config has a required `plex { url; token_file; }` section
  (`token_file` optional). At startup the server lists the Plex libraries,
  and only warns if Plex is unreachable.
- Plex path mapping: `plex.path_mapping` rewrites the paths Plex reports
  to local ones (component-wise, longest prefix, library-scoped rules
  first). `media_path` returns only readable local files, and its error
  names the Plex path, the rule and the mapped path.
- `spoolframe-server plex check-paths [--library <title>]` reports, per
  library, files that are OK, have no matching mapping, or are missing; it
  exits non-zero on any failure. The server samples a few files per
  library at startup and warns for each library that fails.
- `spoolframe-media`: Spoolframe's own ffprobe of each media file into a
  `MediaDescriptor` (container, duration, video, audio and subtitle
  streams, external subtitle files), run with a timeout and cached until
  the file changes. Clients get the `MediaTracks` part (`spoolframe-types`).
- `spoolframe-server media probe <media-id>` prints an item's descriptor.
- The nix package puts ffprobe (`ffmpeg-headless`) on the server's PATH.
- The server has a permanent Iroh identity: a key made on first start in
  `state_dir/endpoint.key` (mode 0600) and only loaded after that; an
  unusable key file stops the server. `spoolframe-server id` prints the
  `EndpointId`.
- The server listens on an Iroh endpoint (LAN only, relays disabled) for
  `spoolframe/client/1`, tracks each connection as anonymous until a
  session says otherwise, and refuses `spoolframe/federation/1` with a
  reason. Optional `network { port; relay; }` config.
- The server runs until SIGINT/SIGTERM, and logs to stderr.
- `spoolframe/client/1` (`spoolframe-protocol`): CBOR messages in
  length-prefixed frames, one QUIC stream per RPC, a server-opened events
  stream, typed errors, and room for newer peers (unknown requests are
  `Unsupported`, unknown errors and events decode as `Unknown`).
- The server speaks it: `Hello` first, answered with `ServerInfo`;
  `AuthMethods`, `LoginPassword` and `Ping` without a session; every other
  request is `Unauthenticated` until sessions exist; `ShuttingDown` on the
  events stream when the server stops. Optional top-level `name` config.
- A server database, `state_dir/spoolframe.db` (SQLite through sqlx, with
  migrations): local users, their password credentials, devices and
  sessions.
- Password login: Argon2id, one error for unknown user / wrong password /
  disabled user, five failures per 15 minutes per username and per source
  before logins are refused. Sessions are stored by token hash. Over Iroh,
  `LoginPassword` now opens a session bound to the client's endpoint;
  `Error::RateLimited` is new in the protocol.
- An admin API: JSON-RPC over WebSocket (`spoolframe-admin-api`), on
  `127.0.0.1:7421` by default (`admin { listen; allow_remote; }`).
  `setup` registers the first admin on an empty server, with the one-time
  setup code the server prints in its log at start; `login`,
  `logout` and user management for admins.
- `spoolframe-server setup` and `spoolframe-server user
  {add,passwd,list,disable,enable}`, which talk to the running server and
  log in like any admin (`SPOOLFRAME_ADMIN_USER`/`_PASSWORD` for
  scripts).
- Client sessions are checked on every request: a session works only from
  the endpoint that logged in, and one connection can carry several
  users' sessions. Sessions last 90 days from last use. New requests
  `WhoAmI`, `Logout` and `ListSessions`; `Hello` takes an optional
  `device_name`. Users have an optional display name (`user add
  --display-name`).
- In a session, clients now get the catalog: `Libraries`, `Items`,
  `Item`, `Search` and `Tracks` (the probed audio and subtitle tracks).
- Playback planning: a shared codec vocabulary (`VideoCodec`,
  `AudioCodec`, `Container`, `SubtitleFormat`) that ffprobe's names map to;
  clients send `ClientCapabilities` in `Hello`; `PlaybackPlan { id,
  selection }` answers `Direct` or `Unsupported` with a reason per
  stream, planning only the container, video and the selected tracks.
  `Remux` and `Transcode` exist on the wire for Phase 2.
- Artwork: clients get posters and backgrounds from the server on their
  own stream (`ArtworkRequest` → `ArtworkResponse` and the bytes), at
  fixed sizes (thumb 160, small 320, medium 640, large 1280, original),
  in a session. The server fetches each image once from the catalog,
  resizes it itself and keeps it in an on-disk cache under
  `artwork { cache_mb; }` (1024 MiB by default). Only real Plex image
  paths are ever fetched.
- Direct play over Iroh: `StartPlayback { id, selection }` plans the item
  and, if it plays directly, opens a playback handle; the client reads the
  file in ranges on `MEDIA` streams (`MediaRead` → `MediaReadReply { sent,
  size }` and the bytes, at most 16 MiB a read, many in flight). Handles
  are bound to their session and endpoint, expire after 5 minutes idle
  (`PlaybackExpired`), and re-check the session every 30 s. A selected
  external subtitle comes whole through `ReadSubtitle`.
- Watch state per user (movies and episodes): `UpdatePlaybackProgress`,
  `MarkWatched`, `MarkUnwatched`; started after 60 s, watched at 90% or
  with under 5 minutes left (`watch { … }` config), progress written at
  most every 10 s per item. Every `Items`, `Item` and `Search` reply
  carries the user's own `PlaybackState`.
- `Home`: continue watching, next up (the episode after the latest
  watched one of recently watched shows) and recently added.
- The server announces itself on the LAN over mDNS (service
  `_spoolframe._udp.local`, its name in the record); `network { mdns =
  false; }` keeps it off. Hosts need inbound UDP 5353 open to hear it.
- `spoolframe-client-sdk`: `Client::open(storage, device)` with the
  app's `Storage` (secrets and plain data). The device key is made once
  and never replaced; unreadable storage is an error. The client lists
  servers heard on the LAN and saved ones (`servers()`), takes typed-in
  addresses (`add_address`), and pins a server's key on first `connect`;
  a server with the same name and another key stays a separate server.
  The client never announces itself.
- SDK sessions: `sign_in`, `profiles` ("who's watching", named by
  `WhoAmI`), and a `Session` per user with typed calls: home, libraries,
  items, item, search, tracks, playback plan, start playback, range reads,
  subtitles, artwork, progress and watched marks, sessions and sign-out.
  Every session shares the device's one connection to a server. A session
  the server no longer knows is forgotten, and the call says
  `SignInRequired`.
- The SDK keeps each server connected: when the connection is lost or the
  server says it is shutting down, it dials the pinned key again (backoff
  from 250 ms to 10 s) and the sessions go on working. `Client::state`
  reports `Disconnected`, `Connecting`, `Connected` and `Reconnecting {
  attempt }`. A call made while reconnecting waits up to 10 s, then fails
  with `Unreachable`.
- Track roles: every audio track is `main`, `audio_description`,
  `commentary` or `other`, every subtitle `full`, `sdh`, `forced` or
  `commentary`, from the file's disposition flags and then its title
  (whole words: "Audio Description", "SDH", "Forced", …) or, for subtitle
  files, `.sdh`/`.cc`/`.hi` in the name. `Tracks` replies carry them.
- Track preferences per user (`GetTrackPreferences`,
  `SetTrackPreferences`): audio languages and roles to avoid; subtitle
  mode (`always`, `foreign_only`, `forced_only`, `off`), languages and
  SDH. `PlaybackPlan` and `StartPlayback` without a `selection` let the
  server choose the tracks; the reply's `chosen` says which and why. A
  pick can be kept for the rest of a series or for a movie
  (`SetTrackOverride`, `ClearTrackOverride`), by language and role.
- A NixOS module, `services.spoolframe` (`nixosModules.spoolframe`, also
  re-exported by foundry's root flake): a hardened service under its own
  user, the Plex token as a systemd credential, path mappings, the port
  and mDNS, and a `spoolframe` admin CLI that knows the host's config.
  `checks.nixos-module` runs it in a VM.
- Encoder detection (P2-02): at start and on SIGHUP the server
  test-encodes with every VA-API, NVENC, QSV and software video encoder
  ffmpeg lists and keeps the ones that work, hardware first; audio
  encoders come from ffmpeg's list. `transcode { hardware = "auto" |
  "vaapi" | "nvenc" | "qsv" | "none"; vaapi_device; }`, and `media {
  ffmpeg; ffprobe; }` for the tool paths. `spoolframe-server status` (the
  admin API's `serverStatus`) shows what was found. The NixOS module
  gives the service the GPU's device nodes when hardware may be used.
- Converted playback plans (P2-01). Capabilities gain `delivery` (range,
  hls, progressive), `max_video` (height, frame rate, bit depth, HDR
  formats shown), `max_audio_channels` and `max_bitrate`, all optional.
  `Remux` and `Transcode` become one `Converted` plan: per stream copy or
  encode, subtitles copied, converted (to WebVTT for HLS) or burned in,
  with reasons. The planner copies what fits and encodes the rest with
  the detected encoders; a Phase 1 client gets the plans it got before.
  `StartPlayback` refuses a converted plan until conversions are served
  (P2-03), naming why it would convert.
