# publish-changed: publish-on-version-change for cargo workspaces.
#
# For each given workspace root: read the workspace's publishable crates
# from `cargo metadata` (respecting each crate's `publish` field and
# `registry` fields — never a hand-maintained list), compute their
# topological dependency order (deps before dependents — the coldsteel
# registry rejects a crate whose in-workspace dep versions aren't present
# yet), and for each crate compare its Cargo.toml version against the
# coldsteel kellnr sparse index. A version already on the index is skipped;
# an absent version is reported (dry run, the default) or published
# (--publish).
#
# This is the version-diff mechanism, not a path/tag trigger: it is safe to
# run on every push to master, including pushes that touch nothing
# publishable, and a missed or failed publish self-heals on the next run
# instead of being lost.
#
# Publishing must be opted into explicitly, and only to this registry: every
# crate whose manifest is not `publish = false` must say
# `publish = ["coldsteel"]` exactly. An absent `publish` field — and the
# equivalent `publish = true` — means "publishable to crates.io", so a
# workspace root added to this job would carry every such crate onto the
# registry by default. That is a hard error here, not a skip.
#
# Copied from foundry's scripts/publish-changed.sh when spoolframe left the
# monorepo; .forgejo/workflows/publish.yaml runs it on every master push.
#
# Requires on PATH: cargo (the workspace's own toolchain — run this inside
# that workspace's devenv shell so `cargo publish`'s verify build has the
# right native deps), curl, jq.
#
# Usage:
#   publish-changed.sh [--publish] [--] <workspace-root> [<workspace-root> ...]
#
# Options:
#   --publish   Actually run `cargo publish` for crates found absent from
#               the index. Requires CARGO_REGISTRIES_COLDSTEEL_TOKEN.
#               Without this flag the script only reports what it would do
#               (dry run) and never touches the registry beyond reading
#               the sparse index.
#   -h, --help  Show this help.
#
# A publish failure aborts the script immediately (no silent skip) — the
# job that runs this must go red, because a red publish job means every
# downstream CI build resolving these crates is about to be wrong.
#
# Exit status: 0 if every configured workspace was processed without a
# publish error; 1 on any hard failure (bad workspace, registry
# unreachable, publish failed, dependency cycle among publishable crates,
# a crate that is publishable without an explicit `publish = ["coldsteel"]`).
